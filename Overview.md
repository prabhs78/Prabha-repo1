# Operations
The RESTCONF protocol uses HTTP methods to identify the CRUD operation requested for a 
particular resource. The RESTCONF operations available are: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and 
DELETE.

* GET - The GET method is sent by the client to retrieve data and meta-data for a resource. It is supported for all resource types, except operation resources.
* POST - The POST method is sent by the client to create a data resource or invoke an operation resource.
* PUT - The PUT method is sent by the client to create or replace the target resource.
* PATCH - The PATCH method is used to create or update a sub-resource within the target resource. If the target resource instance does not exist, the server WILL NOT create it.
* DELETE - The DELETE method is used to delete the target resource. If the DELETE method succeeds, a "204 NoContent" Status-Line is returned, and there is no response message body.
